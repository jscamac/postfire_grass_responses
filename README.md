# Most temperate Australian perennial native grasses respond to drought and fire by resprouting

By *Nicholas A. Moore, James S. Camac and John W. Morgan*

Fire is an integral ecological process affecting grassland ecosystems since the Miocene. However, little is known as to how perennial grass species with different evolutionary histories and photosynthetic pathways respond to fire, or how such responses varies with plant stress at the time of burning. In this study we use a glasshouse drought experiment coupled with experimental burning to examine post-fire resprouting capacity --- measured as the probability of surviving fire and the number of resprouting tillers, assuming survival. We ask: (i) Does post-fire resprout capacity, vary between C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways? (ii) Does response vary by grass tribe? And (iii) does post-fire resprouting vary with pre-fire drought stress?  

We examined responses of 52 temperate perennial Australian grass species, spanning 37 genera. Before experimental burning, three watering frequencies were applied for 35 days to simulate increasing drought. Photosynthetic pathways, watering treatment, Pre-fire tiller density and Leaf Dry Matter Content were measured as explanatory variables to assess fire response (survival and number of post-fire tillers given survival).
